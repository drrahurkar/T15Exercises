### Introduction

The last decade or so has seen tremendous changes in the healthcare landscape. Most notably, paper records have now been replaced by electronic health records (EHRs). These records capture highly detailed informatin regarding the care a patient receives. This includes information on medications received, tests performed, diaognises, hospital stays etc. As you can imagine this data can be higly valuable from a research standpoint. However, due to its sheer volume and granularity, analyzing data dervied from an EHR poses some challenges.

In the following exercises, we will see some examples of ways in which EHR-derived data can be manipulated and used to answer research questions.

**Note: while the datasets used in these exercises have been derived from real EHR data, for privacy and security purposes they have been deidentified as well as perturbed. Since individual observations in the data have been modified, spurious associtions may be discovered and as such, these findings should \*NOT\* be considered as evidence or as scientific premise for future research.**

### The Premise
You are a researcher who is interested in studying glycemic control in diabetic patients. You have just been given access to EHR-derived data on Type-2 Diabetes patients and are looking to use this data to examine the association between glycemic control and body mass index.

### The Tasks
You intend to publish your findings in a journal and as such in order to do so, you need to do a few things.
